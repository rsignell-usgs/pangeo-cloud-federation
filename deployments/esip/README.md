- **[About Pangeo](https://pangeo-data.github.io/):** Pangeo is a community effort for big data in the geosciences using Python. A key component of the Pangeo effort is the improved integration of [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html) and [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html) to enable analysis of very large datasets.
